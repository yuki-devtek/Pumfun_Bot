**>>WARNNING ON SCAMS IN ISSUES COMMENT SECTION<<**

The issues comment section is often targeted by scam bots willing to redirect you to an external resource and drain your funds.

I have enabled a GitHub actions script to detect the common patterns and tag them, which obviously is not 100% accurate.

This is also why you will see deleted comments in the issues—I only delete the scam bot comments targeting your private keys.

The official maintainers are in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file.

Not everyone is a scammer though, sometimes there are helpful outside devs who comment and I absolutely appreciate it.

**>>END OF WARNING<<**

Development ongoing in the [refactored/main-v2](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pump-fun-bot/commits/refactored/main-v2/) branch.

As of March 21, 2025, the bot from the **refactored/main-v2** branch is signficantly better over the **main** version, so the suggestion is to FAFO with v2.

Leave your feedback by opening **Issues**.

# Pump.fun bot development roadmap

| Stage | Feature | Comments | Implementation status
|-------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Stage 1: General updates & QoL** | Lib updates | Updating to the latest libraries | ✅ |
| | Error handling | Improving error handling | WIP | 
| | Configurable RPS | Ability to set RPS in the config to match your provider's and plan RPS (preferably [Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/) 🤩) | WIP |
| | Dynamic priority fees | Ability to set dynamic priority fees | ✅ |
| | Review & optimize `json`, `jsonParsed`, `base64` | Improve speed and traffic for calls, not just `getBlock`. [Helpful overview](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/solana-optimize-your-getblock-performance#json-jsonparsed-base58-base64).| ✅ | 
| **Stage 2: Bonding curve and migration management** | `logsSubscribe` integration | Integrate `logsSubscribe` instead of `blockSubscribe` for sniping minted tokens into the main bot | ✅ |
| | Dual subscription methods | Keep both `logsSubscribe` & `blockSubscribe` in the main bot for flexibility and adapting to Solana node architecture changes | ✅ |
| | Transaction retries | Do retries instead of cooldown and/or keep the cooldown | WIP |
| | Bonding curve status tracking | Checking a bonding curve status progress. Predict how soon a token will start the migration process | WIP | 
| | Account closure script | Script to close the associated bonding curve account if the rest of the flow txs fails | ✅ |
| | PumpSwap migration listening | pump_fun migrated to their own DEX — [PumpSwap](https://x.com/pumpdotfun/status/1902762309950292010), so we need to FAFO with that instead of Raydium (and attempt `logSubscribe` implementation) | ✅ |
| **Stage 3: Trading experience** | Take profit/stop loss | Implement take profit, stop loss exit strategies | FAFO |
| | Market cap-based selling | Sell when a specific market cap has been reached | Not started |
| | Copy trading | Enable copy trading functionality | Not started |
| | Token analysis script | Script for basic token analysis (market cap, creator investment, liquidity, token age) | Not started |
| | Archive node integration | Use Solana archive nodes for historical analysis (accounts that consistently print tokens, average mint to raydium time) | Not started |
| | Geyser implementation | Leverage Solana Geyser for real-time data stream processing | ✅ |
| **Stage 4: Minting experience** | Token minting | Ability to mint tokens (based on user request - someone minted 18k tokens) | FAFO |


## Development Timeline
- Development begins: Week of March 10, 2025
- Implementation approach: Gradual rollout in separate branch
- Priority: Stages progress from simple to complex features
- Completion guarantee: Full completion of Stage 1, other stages dependent on feedback and feasibility

For the full walkthrough, see [Solana: Creating a trading and sniping pump.fun bot](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/solana-creating-a-pumpfun-bot).

For near-instantaneous transaction propagation, you can use the [Chainstack Solana Trader nodes](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/trader-nodes).

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager.

> If Python is already installed, `uv` will detect and use it automatically.

### Installation

#### 1️⃣ Install Python (if needed)
```bash
uv python install
```
> **Why?** `uv` will fetch and install the required Python version for your system.

#### 2️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pump-fun-bot.git
cd pump-fun-bot
```

#### 3️⃣ Set up a virtual environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate (Unix/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate  

# Activate (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
> Virtual environments help keep dependencies isolated and prevent conflicts.

#### 4️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```
> **Why `-e` (editable mode)?** Lets you modify the code without reinstalling the package—useful for development!

#### 5️⃣ Configure the bot
```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env  # Unix/macOS

# Windows
copy .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file and add your **Solana RPC endpoints** and **private key**.

### Running the bot

```bash
# Option 1: run as installed package
pump_bot --help

# Option 2: run directly
python -m src.cli --help
```

> **You're all set! 🎉**  Now you can start using the bot. Check `--help` for available commands. 🚀

## Note on limits

Solana is an amazing piece of web3 architecture, but it's also very complex to maintain.

Chainstack is daily (literally, including weekends) working on optimizing our Solana infrastructure to make it the best in the industry.

That said, all node providers have their own setup recommendations & limits, like method availability, requests per second (RPS), free and paid plan specific limitations and so on.

So please make sure you consult the docs of the node provider you are going to use for the bot here. And obviously the public RPC nodes won't work for the heavier use case scenarios like this bot.

For Chainstack, all of the details and limits you need to be aware of are consolidated here: [Limits](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/limits) <— we are _always_ keeping this piece up to date so you can rely on it.

## Changelog

Quick note on a couple on a few new scripts in `/learning-examples`:

*(this is basically a changelog now)*

Also, here's a quick doc: [Listening to pump.fun migrations to Raydium](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/solana-listening-to-pumpfun-migrations-to-raydium)

## Bonding curve state check

`check_boding_curve_status.py` — checks the state of the bonding curve associated with a token. When the bonding curve state is completed, the token is migrated to Raydium.

To run:

`python check_boding_curve_status.py TOKEN_ADDRESS`

## Listening to the Raydium migration

When the bonding curve state completes, the liquidity and the token graduate to Raydium.

`listen_to_raydium_migration.py` — listens to the migration events of the tokens from pump_fun to Raydium and prints the signature of the migration, the token address, and the liquidity pool address on Raydium.

Note that it's using the [blockSubscribe]([url](https://docs.chainstack.com/reference/blocksubscribe-solana)) method that not all providers support, but Chainstack does and I (although obviously biased) found it pretty reliable.

To run:

`python listen_to_raydium_migration.py`

**The following two new additions are based on this question [associatedBondingCurve #26](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pump-fun-bot/issues/26)**

You can take the compute the associatedBondingCurve address following the [Solana docs PDA](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda) description logic. Take the following as input *as seed* (order seems to matter):

- bondingCurve address
- the Solana system token program address: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
- the token mint address

And compute against the Solana system associated token account program address: `ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL`.

The implications of this are kinda huge:
* you can now use `logsSubscribe` to snipe the tokens and you are not limited to the `blockSubscribe` method
* see which one is faster
* not every provider supports `blockSubscribe` on lower tier plans or at all, but everyone supports `logsSubscribe`

The following script showcase the implementation.

## Compute associated bonding curve

`compute_associated_bonding_curve.py` — computes the associated bonding curve for a given token.    

To run:

`python compute_associated_bonding_curve.py` and then enter the token mint address.

## Listen to new direct full details

`listen_new_direct_full_details.py` — listens to the new direct full details events and prints the signature, the token address, the user, the bonding curve address, and the associated bonding curve address using just the `logsSubscribe` method. Basically everything you need for sniping using just `logsSubscribe` and no extra calls like doing `getTransaction` to get the missing data. It's just computed on the fly now.

To run:

`python listen_new_direct_full_details.py`

So now you can run `listen_create_from_blocksubscribe.py` and `listen_new_direct_full_details.py` at the same time and see which one is faster.

Also here's a doc on this: [Solana: Listening to pump.fun token mint using only logsSubscribe](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/solana-listening-to-pumpfun-token-mint-using-only-logssubscribe)
