For the full walkthrough, see [Solana: Creating a trading and sniping pump.fun bot](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/solana-creating-a-pumpfun-bot).

For near-instantaneous transaction propagation, you can use the [Chainstack Solana Trader nodes](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/trader-nodes).

[Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com).

Make sure you have the required packages installed `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Make sure you have your endpoints set up in `config.py`.

Quick note on a couple on a few new scripts in `/learning-examples`:

*(this is basically a changelog now)*

## Bonding curve state check

`check_boding_curve_status.py` — checks the state of the bonding curve associated with a token. When the bonding curve state is completed, the token is migrated to Raydium.

To run:

`python check_boding_curve_status.py TOKEN_ADDRESS`

## Listening to the Raydium migration

When the bonding curve state completes, the liquidity and the token graduate to Raydium.

`listen_to_raydium_migration.py` — listens to the migration events of the tokens from pump_fun to Raydium and prints the signature of the migration, the token address, and the liquidity pool address on Raydium.

Note that it's using the [blockSubscribe]([url](https://docs.chainstack.com/reference/blocksubscribe-solana)) method that not all providers support, but Chainstack does and I (although obviously biased) found it pretty reliable.

To run:

`python listen_to_raydium_migration.py`

**The following two new additions are based on this question [associatedBondingCurve #26](https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pump-fun-bot/issues/26)**

You can take the compute the associatedBondingCurve address following the [Solana docs PDA](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda) description logic. Take the following as input *as seed* (order seems to matter):

- bondingCurve address
- the Solana system token program address: `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`
- the token mint address

And compute against the Solana system associated token account program address: `ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL`.

The implications of this are kinda huge:
* you can now use `logsSubscribe` to snipe the tokens and you are not limited to the `blockSubscribe` method
* see which one is faster
* not every provider supports `blockSubscribe` on lower tier plans or at all, but everyone supports `logsSubscribe`

The following script showcase the implementation.

## Compute associated bonding curve

`compute_associated_bonding_curve.py` — computes the associated bonding curve for a given token.    

To run:

`python compute_associated_bonding_curve.py` and then enter the token mint address.

## Listen to new direct full details

`listen_new_direct_full_details.py` — listens to the new direct full details events and prints the signature, the token address, the user, the bonding curve address, and the associated bonding curve address using just the `logsSubscribe` method. Basically everything you need for sniping using just `logsSubscribe` and no extra calls like doing `getTransaction` to get the missing data. It's just computed on the fly now.

To run:

`python listen_new_direct_full_details.py`

So now you can run `listen_create_from_blocksubscribe.py` and `listen_new_direct_full_details.py` at the same time and see which one is faster.
